# .larger[What is Git]

---
class: middle 

# Git is a __version control system__

- It is an application that runs on your computer, just like Microsoft Word or Google Chrome.

- Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects.

# .larger[What does<br/>Git do]

---
class: middle

# Git manages the evolution of a set of files 

Imagine “Track Changes” from Microsoft Word on a whole directory instead of just one file.

# Git for Data Science

Git has been 'repurposed' for managing<sup>1</sup> activities other than software development:

--

managing code to clean, merge, reshape, or analyze data (wrangling).

- [My NHANES starter kit](https://github.com/bcjaeger/NHANES-starter-kit)

- [INTERMACS ML imputation](https://github.com/bcjaeger/INTERMACS-imputation-ML)

--

managing blogs, books, or scientific articles in an open setting.

- [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds)
    
- [Advanced R by Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley/adv-r)

--

managing highly relevant data sets:

- [NY Times COVID-19 data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)

If you don't have that screen, don't worry. By clicking the pencil, 

- you have created a copy of this repo on your profile

- you have created a new branch of the repo within your profile's copy.

- you can navigate to it by going to your profile.

- (I will demo this if there is time)
